## HTML Block and Inline Elements
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

There are two display values: block and inline.

### **Block-level Elements**
A block-level element always starts on a new line.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.

The <div> element is a block-level element.

### **Inline Elements**
An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

## Notes
- Usually use 1 h1 per page
- index.html will be the home page.
